abstract = "The 82nd Airborne Division serves as America's strategic response force, and provides the ability to execute global force projection through large scale combat parachute assault operations. A detailed out-load plan is necessary to rapidly deploy the Global Response Force (GRF). The length of time that administrative and logistical tasks take during the out-load process tend to minimize the amount of time that soldiers and leaders have to plan and rehearse their mission.  Our team assisted in analyzing the out-load process and made time saving recommendations in order to maximize the time available for Soldiers and leaders to conduct mission planning and rehearsals. In particular, our team collaborated with the 82nd Airborne Division Operational Research and Systems Analysis (ORSA) Cell in developing an Out-load Decision Support Tool (ODST) that rapidly builds a Priority Vehicle List (PVL) and optimizes vehicle assignment to various types of aircraft given a mission profile and a unique brigade vehicle and capability list."
