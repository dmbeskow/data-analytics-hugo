abstract = "Tactical Integrated Ground Reporting (TIGR) is a web-based geographic information sharing and reporting system, which is currently used by all U.S. Army Brigades in Afghanistan and Iraq.  TIGR receives and displays spatial combat reports entered directly by operational units. It also merges data from established databases, notably Combined Information Data Network Exchange (CIDNE). TIGR, however, is only as accurate as the discipline, reporting standards, and priorities of these tactical units.  This design creates limitations, due to a lack of standardization between units, various levels of use between and within units, and duplication of some reports.  Regardless, TIGR provides the most descriptive and comprehensive data of friendly and enemy action for both Afghanistan and Iraq, and yet has not been exploited for operational analysis. This thesis conducts spatial and temporal exploratory data analysis of TIGR in order to document the characteristics and usefulness of this critical data set while developing a general spatial exploratory data analysis toolbox for use in evaluating an operational environment.  The most prominent of these tools are population weighting of friendly force activity, graphical visualization of the centers of friendly and enemy activity over time, and company level time analysis.
