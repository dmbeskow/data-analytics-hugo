abstract = "The U.S. Army is responsible for adequately planning and budgeting for future use of public funds.  Part of this planning includes estimating the future cost, or requirement, for the various services that support Army installations around the world.  These services range from basic utilities to substance abuse programs, and directly support the Army mission.  The Base Operations Support Requirement Model (BRM) provides estimated requirements for 61 services that support Army installations.  These estimated requirements comprise more than 70% of total Base Operations Support (BOS) requirements.  Currently, Standard Service Costing (SSC) uses historical execution data, installation data, linear regression statistical processes, and quality/funding association rules to forecast future *should-cost* requirements at four distinct levels of service (*Green*, *Amber*, *Red*, and *Black* service levels). This study analyzes the historical performance of these statistical processes and explores alternative methods for determining future service requirements at installation granularity.  "
