# Analytic Musing and Munging

As an Army ORSA Analyst, I use this website to host research products, record my analytic musing, and link to various cloud computing resources when necessary.  

For those who have used resources that I maintained on my last WordPress site and associated VPS, I have tried to maintain all legacy products for you to access here.

- I am a passionate follower of Jesus Christ (Galatians 2:20)
- I am a committed husband and father
- I am a committed Soldier and a constantly learning leader
- I am a creative problem solver who enjoys the challenges posed by operations research and systems analysis
